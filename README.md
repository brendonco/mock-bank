## Getting Started

Open a terminal / command prompt and run the `setup.sh` file to install node packages.

The above installs the node dependencies for the main package.json file, along
with dependencies for the API and UI folders.

Start the application:

```bash
yarn start
```

The above will start the UI on port 3000 and start the API on port 3001.

API project uses a fake REST API thanks to [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for 30 seconds setup.
